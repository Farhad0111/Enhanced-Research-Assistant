Research Topic: IoV in AI

Summary:
The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is rapidly evolving, with AI playing a crucial role in enhancing its capabilities.  AI algorithms are used in various aspects of IoV, including autonomous driving, traffic management, and predictive maintenance.  Autonomous driving relies heavily on AI for perception, decision-making, and control. AI-powered traffic management systems optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Predictive maintenance uses AI to anticipate potential vehicle failures, improving safety and reducing downtime.  However, challenges remain, such as data security, privacy concerns, and the need for robust and reliable AI algorithms in real-world scenarios.
