Research Topic: IOV in Cybersecurity

Summary:
IOV (Internet of Vehicles) presents unique cybersecurity challenges due to its interconnected nature.  Vehicles are becoming increasingly reliant on network connectivity, exposing them to various threats such as data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, and manipulation of vehicle systems.  Securing IOV requires a multi-layered approach, encompassing vehicle-level security measures, secure communication protocols, and robust infrastructure protection.  Key concerns include authentication and authorization mechanisms, data encryption, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and vulnerability management.  The complexity of IOV systems and the diverse range of stakeholders involved necessitate collaboration and standardization efforts to mitigate these risks effectively.
